# db-setup
This project contains 3 examples of connecting to a database server. In the mongo folder, we connect to mongoDB. In the other two folders, we connect to mySql using either a standard or promisified connection. 

If you clone the repo, make sure to run "npm install" to include the dependencies in package.json.
