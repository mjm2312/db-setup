# db-setup
This project contains 3 examples of connecting to databases servers. In the mongo folder, we connect to mongoDB. In the other two folders, we connect to mySql using either a standard or promisified connection. In each of these three folders, you'll find code to fire up an express server and controller logic in server/index.js. In db, we define and initiate the connection in db/index.js and define methods to interface with the database in db/model.js. 

If you clone the repo, make sure to run "npm install" to include the dependencies in package.json.
